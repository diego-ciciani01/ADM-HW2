# ADM-HW2

Within the folder, you will find a subfolder containing the code used for the AWSQ point. There are two Python files, one intended to run on the EC2 machine and the other on your local machine. Additionally, there will be written documentation documenting all the steps performed to complete the point.

There is also a folder called "command_line_questions" which contains two .sh files, representing the first and second parts of the "command line questions."

Finally, all the remaining code is contained in the `main.ipynb` file.
