# ADM-HW2

Within the folder, you will find a subfolder containing the code used for the AWSQ point. There are two Python files, one intended to run on the EC2 machine and the other on your local machine. 
  - `most_popular_tags.ipynb` 
  - `most_popular_tags_ec2.ipynb`
Additionally,
there will be written documentation documenting all the steps performed to complete the point (`DOC AWS Question (AWSQ) en.pdf`).

There is also a folder called "command_line_questions" which contains two .sh files, representing the first and second parts of the "command line questions."
  - `commandline_LLM.sh`
  - `commandline_original.sh`

Finally, all the remaining code is contained in the `main.ipynb` file.
